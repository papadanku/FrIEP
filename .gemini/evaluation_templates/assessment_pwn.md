_firstname requires ?? and related services to benefit from _firstname's educational program. _firstname displays academic challenges that are closely linked to significant cognitive processing deficits in ?? (??), ?? (??), and ?? (??). These deficits significantly hinder _firstname's ability to engage with the ?? grade general education curriculum.

Proposal #3: The Team considered assessing _firstname in the area of ??.

These discrepancies were demonstrated by the ?? and ?? rating scales, as well as with ?? observations in the classroom setting. The parents concurred with this decision.

## Individualized Education Program (IEP)

Description of the action proposed:

The IEP meeting took place on ?? in the ?? at ??.

The District recommends accepting the IEP created on ??, which covers ??'s current strengths and needs, goals, academic and testing accommodations, related services, and the least restrictive environment (Level A).

Explanation of why the agency proposes to take this action:

The District proposes to take this action because ?? is eligible for special education services under the category of ??. They demonstrate deficits in the areas of ??. They are in need of specially designed instruction to address these deficits.

Description of any options the agency considered:

The District considered:

1. Maintaining support services across all areas of ?? and not adding ?? goals for ??, since their ?? evaluation score does not make them eligible for ?? services.
2. Establishing ?? goals for ?? to address their ?? and other internalizing issues.

Reasons the above listed were rejected:

The reasons the District rejected the options listed above:

1. The District proposes maintaining ?? support while not adding ?? goals because ??'s ?? score does not meet eligibility for ??-specific resource services. However, the IEP team believes that spelling inaccuracies in sentences are not penalized by the writing subtest and that explicit instruction in paragraph and essay writing could meaningfully improve the quality of ??'s writing. This suggests there is value in including targeted writing goals that address both mechanics (spelling) and higher-order writing skills (paragraphing and essay construction), even if formal resource eligibility is not met. The IEP team contends that spelling can enhance overall writing quality and that ?? would benefit from explicit instruction in paragraph and essay writing. This rationale supports incorporating writing goals and related supports within the IEP plan to foster ongoing progress in writing, rather than limiting services to ?? alone, which may overlook potential gains in composite communication outcomes.

2. ?? is already receiving external counseling for ??, and they will have access to a ?? as needed. Introducing formal school-based behavior goals could be seen as duplicative or redundant, duplicating services that are already in place rather than adding value. Also, behavior goals established by the school might not align with ??'s ongoing treatment plan developed by external counselors. This misalignment can create confusion, reduce the effectiveness of interventions, and may be viewed as overstepping boundaries or limiting the family’s choice in treatment approaches.

Description of each evaluation procedure, test, record, or report the agency used/will use as a basis for the proposed action:

The following sources of information were used as bases for making the IEP decisions:

- Parental Input
- MET data/ standardized test results
- Progress reports

- Participants included ?? (mother), ?? (father), ?? (special education teacher, district representative, and instructional implications interpreter), ?? (general education teacher), ?? (social worker), and ?? (school psychologist).
