School Problems: This composite reflects academic difficulties, including problems of motivation, attention, learning, and cognition. A high score on this composite indicates that _firstname displays behaviors likely to interfere with achievement. An overall composite for school problems is only obtained when the BASC-3 is completed by a teacher/educator. _firstname's general education teacher reported concerns within the ??
