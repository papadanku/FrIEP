## ADHD Assessments

### Conners · Fourth Edition

An evaluation of the student’s social and emotional functioning included completion of the Conners 4th Edition (Conners 4). The Conners-4 measures symptoms of, and impairments associated with, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as well as common co-occurring problems and disorders in youths aged 6 to 18 years. The assessment is a multi-informant assessment that takes into account home, social, and school settings, with rating forms for parents, teachers, and youth and is a reliable and dependable tool capable of supporting the diagnostic and identification process. The Conners-4 includes norm-based criteria regarding Attention Deficit with Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) according to the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Children with ADHD tend to display behaviors in two or more settings. Although it remains true that rating scales alone cannot be used to ascertain a diagnosis, this component of the rating scale makes this assessment tool directly related to clinical assessment and diagnosis.

## Interpretation of Social-Emotional Assessment Results Templates

### Template: Conners · Fourth Edition

Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active. To obtain information regarding how closely related _firstname's behavior is to ADHD across settings, the Conners, Fourth Edition (Conners-4) was completed by their mother (_rater1), general education teacher (_rater2), and special education teacher(_rater3). Further details about _firstname's observed behaviors across settings are discussed below.

Inattention/Executive Dysfunction: The Inattention/ Executive Dysfunction scale measures how distractible and detail/ plan-oriented _firstname is. Attention and executive functioning problems can affect one's ability to remain focused on the task, follow directions, and complete multi-step problems. Additionally, planning skills can aid in organization, task completion, and assignment prioritization. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Hyperactivity: The Hyperactivity scale measures how active, restless, and impulsive _firstname is. Students with high levels of hyperactivity tend to have trouble sitting still and being quiet. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Impulsivity: The Impulsivity scale measures how well _firstname can control their initial reactions to an event or stimuli. This includes the ability to have a thought and not act upon that thought. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Emotional Dysregulation: The Emotional Dysregulation scale measures how well _firstname can control their emotions. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Anxious Thoughts: The Anxious Thoughts scale measures _firstname's fears and worries. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

The Conners, Fourth Edition was completed by their mother (_rater1), general education teacher (_rater2), and special education teacher (_rater3) to obtain information regarding _firstname's functional behavior across settings. Further details about _firstname's observed behaviors across settings are discussed below.

Schoolwork: This measures how well _firstname can keep up with the academic demands of the classroom. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Peer Interaction: This measures how well _firstname gets along with others their age. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

Family Life: This measures how _firstname feels about home life. All respondents reported $1 Average Concerns (T-Score = ??) on this scale, which suggests consistent behavior across settings.

The Conners, Fourth Edition (Conners-4) was completed by her mother (_rater1), general education teacher (_rater2), and special education teacher (_rater3) to assess _firstname's behavior across settings. _firstname's ratings were compared with the symptoms in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The DSM is the handbook used by healthcare professionals as a guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders. The DSM contains descriptions, symptoms, and other criteria for diagnosing mental disorders.

ADHD Inattention Symptoms: The DSM criteria for ADHD Inattentive Type requires the presence of at least 6 of the following symptoms: Poor listening skills, frequently losing or misplacing items, easily sidetracked by unimportant stimuli, forgetfulness, diminished attention span, lack of ability to complete schoolwork, avoids or declines to begin homework or other activities that require concentration, makes careless mistakes, and fails to focus on details. All informants reported concerns in the Average range (T-Score = ??) on this scale.

All informants reported concerns in the Average range (T-Score = ??) on this scale.

Total ADHD Symptoms: This scale examines inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. A high score on this scale indicates a DSM diagnosis of ADHD combined presentation. All informants reported concerns in the Average range (T-Score = ??) on this scale.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder: To meet the DSM criteria for Oppositional Defiant Disorder, one must display a pattern of angry/irritable moods and be argumentative/defiant or vindictive for at least 6 months. They must also exhibit at least four symptoms of the following: often lose temper, usually touchy/annoyed, frequently angry/resentful, often argumentative with authority figures, often actively defiant, deliberately annoying, blame others for their mistakes, and spiteful or vindictive.
