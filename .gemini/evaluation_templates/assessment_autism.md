## Template: Autism Spectrum Rating Scales (ASRS)

The Autism Spectrum Rating Scales (ASRS) are norm-referenced rating forms used to quantify observations of children and adolescents from two to eighteen years of age who exhibit behaviors associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders. When combined with other information, results from the ASRS can help determine the likelihood that a child has symptoms related to Autism Spectrum Disorders. The ASRS was completed by _firstname's mother (_rater1), general education teacher (_rater2), and special education teacher (_rater3). Scores of 40 to 59 are considered average, scores below 40 indicate fewer concerns than average, and scores above 59 are considered slightly elevated to very elevated.

Social/Communication: This scale indicates _firstname's ability to appropriately use verbal and non-verbal communication to initiate, engage in, and maintain social contact.

These ratings indicate that _firstname can communicate verbally and nonverbally in social situations.

Unusual Behavior: This scale assesses _firstname's tolerance for changes in routine, engagement in apparently purposeless and stereotypical behaviors, and overreaction to particular sensory experiences. Concerns on the Unusual Behavior scale were considered Average for all respondents, suggesting that _firstname exhibits the same behaviors across settings. These ratings indicate that _firstname's behaviors are typical for their age.

Self-Regulation: This scale indicates how well _firstname manages their behavior and thoughts, maintains focus, and resists distractions.
