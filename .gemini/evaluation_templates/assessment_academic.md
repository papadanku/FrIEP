## Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement

The student was administered the Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Achievement Fourth Edition (WJ- IV) to assess their current levels of academic functioning in the areas of reading, written language, and mathematics. Cluster scores for each of these academic areas are comprised of separate subtests to better understand the broad cluster score.

### Score Classification 

- Standard Score Mean: 100
- Standard Deviation: 15
- Very Superior: 131+
- Superior: 121-130
- High Average: 111-120
- Average: 90-110
- Low Average: 80-89
- Low: 70-79
- Very Low: 69 and below

## Template: Woodcock-Johnson 4 Tests of Achievement

_firstname was administered the WJ-IV to measure their current levels of academic achievement. The WJ-IV is a battery of tests used to measure various aspects of scholastic achievement to ascertain a significant discrepancy between aptitude and ability, design educational plans and programs, and measure academic growth and the effectiveness of educational programs.

Basic Reading Skills

The Basic Reading Skills cluster combines Letter-Word Identification (reading a list of words aloud) and Word Attack (reading nonsense letter combinations that are phonetically consistent or regular patterns in orthography). These tests measure sight word vocabulary and the application of phonics and structural analysis skills. _firstname’s Basic Reading Skills score fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Letter-Word Identification subtest measures _firstname’s ability to read isolated words aloud. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling in the ?? range of functioning.

The Word Attack subtest measured _firstname’s abilities in applying phonics and structural analysis skills to pronounce unfamiliar non-words. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

Reading Comprehension

The Reading Comprehension cluster combines Passage Comprehension (using syntactic and semantic cues to identify the missing words in a text) and Reading Recall (reading a short story silently and then retelling as much of the story as recalled). It is a measure of comprehension and reasoning. _firstname’s Reading Comprehension skills fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Passage Comprehension subtest measured _firstname’s comprehension abilities through pictorial stimuli, increasing to short sentences and, eventually, paragraphs. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

The Reading Recall subtest measured _firstname’s ability to read a short story silently and then reconstruct the story from memory. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

Reading Fluency

The Reading Fluency cluster measures aspects of reading fluency, such as prosody, automaticity, and accuracy. This cluster comprises a combination of Oral Reading (reading sentences aloud) and Sentence Reading Fluency (skimming simple sentences, deciding if the statement is accurate, and selecting either yes or no). _firstname’s Reading Fluency skills fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Oral Reading subtest measures _firstname’s ability to orally read sentences without mispronunciation, omission, insertion, substitution, hesitation, repetition, transposition, and ignoring punctuation. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

The Sentence Reading Fluency subtest measures _firstname’s ability to quickly read and comprehend sentences. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

Math Calculation Skills

The Math Calculation Skills cluster is a measure of computational skills and automaticity. This cluster comprises a combination of Calculation (completing math computations on a worksheet) and Math Fact Fluency (completing simple addition, subtraction, and multiplication facts within a 3-minute time limit). _firstname’s Math Calculation Skills fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Calculation subtest measures _firstname’s ability to perform mathematical computations. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

The Math Facts Fluency subtest measures a _firstname’s ability to quickly solve simple addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication problems during a timed setting (3 minutes). _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

Math Problem Solving

The Math Reasoning cluster combines Applied Problems (analyzing and solving word problems) and Number Matrices (completing number sequences by identifying the missing number). It is a measure of mathematical knowledge and reasoning. _firstname’s Math Problem Solving Skills fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Applied Problems subtest requires the student to analyze and solve math problems. To solve the issues, the student must listen to the problem, recognize the procedure to follow and perform relatively simple calculations. Because many problems include extraneous information, the student must decide which mathematical operations to use and which numbers to include in the Calculation. _firstname’s performance on this subtest fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Number Matrices subtest measures quantitative reasoning, requiring both quantitative knowledge and fluid reasoning abilities. A matrix is presented, and the student must identify the missing number. _firstname’s performance on this subtest fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

Written Expression

The Written Expression cluster is a measure of meaningful written expression and fluency. This cluster combines Writing Samples (composing sentences based on directions given and sentences evaluated concerning the quality of expression) and Sentence Writing Fluency (formulating a simple sentence when presented with a stimulus picture and three words in a 5-minute time limit). _firstname’s Written Expression skills fell in the ?? range (SS: ??).

The Writing Samples subtest measured _firstname’s writing skills in response to various demands that increased in difficulty. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.

The Sentence Writing Fluency subtest measured _firstname’s fluency for quickly formulating and writing simple sentences. _firstname’s score on this subtest yielded a standard score of ??, falling within the ?? range of functioning.
