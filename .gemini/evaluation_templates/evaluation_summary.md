## Summary (General review of all data)

### Template: Summary (General review of all data)

_firstname is a ?? grader attending Orangewood School in the Washington Elementary School District. _firstname is due for their triennial review of educational data. The evaluation aims to determine current functional, behavioral, and academic skill levels and whether or not sufficient data exists for educational decision-making. _firstname has received special educational services for a ??. 

The District uses a dual discrepancy-consistency model for SLD identification utilizing the CHC broad and narrow ability factor scores, achievement scores, and academic correlate information in addition to other cumulative and supportive data. In addition to identifying cognitive strengths and weaknesses, the cognitive weakness must correlate with academic weaknesses. According to the current evaluation, _firstname does indicate cognitive processing strengths in the areas of Visual Spatial (Gv), Fluid Reasoning (Gf), Short-Term Memory (Gsm), and Cognitive Processing Speed (Gs), with cognitive processing weakness in the areas of Auditory processing (Ga), Long-Term Retrieval (Glr), and Knowledge (Gc). _firstname’s cognitive processing weakness in Long-Term Memory (Glr) and Crystalized Intelligence (Gc) correlates with their identified academic weaknesses in basic reading, reading fluency, and written expression. _firstname meets the criteria for special education services as a student with a specific learning disability (basic reading, reading fluency, and written expression). The MET team will convene to discuss the results of this assessment and determine _firstname's appropriate eligibility and educational placement. As always, the team must review all relevant information before deciding on appropriate educational programming for _firstname.

## Examples: Documentation of educational implications of suspected disability

_firstname has significant difficulty progressing within their reading fluency skills within the general educational setting and requires appropriate modifications, accommodations, and support to benefit from their educational programming. Their Specific Learning Disability (SLD) limits their ability to perform academically and at a level commensurate with their non-disabled peers. _firstname's lower overall cognitive ability and lower fluid reasoning skills can affect their overall fluency skills. Their slower processing of information and difficulties with recall and memory due to their lower overall cognitive and fluid reasoning skills (poor reasoning ability, difficulties linking visual information to abstract concepts, and understanding conceptual or quantitative concepts) can significantly affect their recall and fluency skills.

_firstname's writing deficits will impact their ability to learn the instructional materials. If support is not in place to support _firstname in writing, _firstname will continue to fall behind classroom peers in various writing tasks related to instructional activities, written tests, and worksheets in the general education curriculum.

_firstname's math calculation deficits will impact their learning of the instructional materials. If support is not in place to help _firstname with math calculation, they will continue to fall behind their classroom peers in learning math concepts and operations and knowing which operations and procedures to use for particular problems in the general education curriculum.

_firstname's reading deficits will impact their ability to learn the instructional materials. If support is not in place to support _firstname in reading, _firstname will continue to fall behind classroom peers in reading tasks, from reading textbooks, worksheets, and test questions to answering questions and participating in academic discussions in the general education curriculum.

_firstname's autism/ADHD behaviors (i.e., being anxious, worried, and aloof) cause them to have difficulty paying attention and participating in the classroom. _firstname also has a cognitive deficiency in working memory and processing speed. They have problems with short-term working memory, processing tasks, visual motor coordination, and cognitive flexibility. Despite receiving special education services for years, _firstname struggles with certain academic skills, especially in written expression, reading, and math. If support is not in place to support _firstname in writing, they will continue to fall behind their classroom peers in various writing tasks related to instructional activities, written tests, and worksheets. Without math support, they will continue to fall behind their classroom peers in learning math concepts and operations, knowing which operations and procedures to use for particular problems, and using abstract thinking to solve word problems. Without support in reading, they will continue to fall behind their classroom peers in reading tasks, from reading textbooks, worksheets, and test questions to answering questions and participating in academic discussions in the general education curriculum.

_firstname presents with intellectual skills delays, affecting their ability to process, recall, and retain information in the classroom. _firstname also may struggle to engage in higher-level thinking. These intellectual weaknesses negatively impact their ability to access the grade-level curriculum, as evidenced by _firstname's being far below grade level in most academic areas. _firstname will benefit from explicit, repetitive instruction in foundational academic concepts within their current instructional level. Additionally, _firstname presents with delays in their adaptive behavioral skills, which affect their ability to socialize and communicate with others, take care of their daily needs, organize themselves, and navigate their environments independently.

_firstname's disability affects their ability to access the general curriculum. Despite having average cognitive abilities in most areas and receiving special education services for years, _firstname struggles with certain academic skills, especially in written expression, reading decoding, and math computation. _firstname's disability impacts the extent to which they can write understandably and express their thoughts in written form. _firstname's suspected disability also affects the degree to which they performs complex math computations, especially those that involve multiple steps. Finally, _firstname's disability causes them to have difficulty decoding complex, unfamiliar words, which may affect their reading comprehension.

_firstname's regulation of their self-control and emotions is limited, as demonstrated by the questionnaires completed by the teacher and parent and daily classroom performance. If support is not in place to support _firstname with behaviors, _firstname may have difficulty participating in academic discussions and interactions within the classroom with peers and adults.

_firstname qualifies under the category Other Health Impairment, as they has a medical diagnosis of ADHD, which impacts their ability to progress without specialized instruction. They struggles with inattention, organization, hyperactivity/impulsivity, learning problems, trouble with executive functioning, defiance, and peer relationships. Current evaluation data demonstrates they has poor concentration, makes careless mistakes, or becomes easily distracted in the classroom. They has difficulty with concentration during instruction, which may lead to trouble remembering concepts taught. _firstname also has trouble starting and finishing projects, planning or prioritizing work, and organizing himself. Behaviorally, they is often defiant and argumentative towards staff and peers.

_firstname's cognitive abilities are limited in the areas that classroom learning requires. Their visual spatial and nonverbal reasoning abilities fell in the ?? range for their age. In contrast, their working memory, cognitive proficiency, and verbal comprehension abilities were significantly weaker and fell in the ?? range. These results indicate that learning will be challenging for _firstname as classroom instruction requires verbal skills, memory, attention, and cognitive efficiency. Visual support and memory strategies for learning will need to be employed. On the academic standardized assessment, _firstname's age equivalence for their performance remains clustered around an early 5-year-old level, nearly two years below their chronological age. Their limited academic skills make classroom participation challenging. _firstname requires specialized instruction to address their reading, writing, and mathematics academic delays.

_firstname's adaptive behavior skills in all areas were significantly delayed. The four standard scores obtained ranged from 60 to 72, indicating that _firstname's conceptual thinking, social skills, practical living skills, and overall score are significantly delayed relative to expected levels for nearly 7-year-old boys. Their limited adaptive behavior will be addressed through the positive intervention plan that will teach and reinforce more age-appropriate habits.

_firstname exhibits an intellectual disability that adversely affects performance in the educational environment, as evidenced by performance on a standard measure of intellectual functioning that is between two and three standard deviations below the mean for students of the same age. Socially and behaviorally, _firstname has difficulty initiating/sustaining play or interaction with peers. _firstname would benefit from modeling and reinforcing social skills, especially how to appropriately approach a peer and initiate a response. In addition, _firstname may become irritated during non-preferred activities. _firstname may also be triggered by other students' behaviors or when becoming overwhelmed by sensory stimuli. This may cause _firstname to get upset or withdraw. _firstname requires direct instruction in social skills, problem-solving, and coping strategies, clearly stated expectations, high positive reinforcement rates, and consistent accountability measures.

_firstname is reading significantly below grade level. Because of _firstname's limited reading fluency and ability, _firstname cannot access their grade-level text in all content areas. _firstname cannot express their thoughts and ideas effectively, limiting their comprehension and opportunities for vocabulary expansion. _firstname has difficulty understanding relationships between new concepts, generalizing or making connections between new material and acquired knowledge, and limited problem-solving skills in new and everyday situations. _firstname has difficulty applying math skills in different areas and determining the best solution to a word problem.

## Examples: Consideration as to whether any additions or modifications to the special education or related services are needed for the student to progress in the general curriculum.

_firstname has been receiving special education services in the resource classroom and progressing in this setting;. However, based on the evaluation results, the team would like to consider increasing _firstname's service minutes to provide them with further, specially designed academic instruction to address areas of need (Written Expression, Basic Reading Skills, Math Computation, Reading Comprehension, and Reading Fluency).

Utilize visual modalities when introducing new and/or old concepts to _firstname to help them better encode/learn the material being presented. Teach _firstname to use context clues to identify words and phrases. Highlighting important vocabulary for each class in each subject area will help increase their comprehension and learning of the material being presented to them in class. When needed, provide extra time on any timed and/or untimed tests/quizzes and/or assignments to help accommodate their lower processing and fluency abilities. Provide _firstname with class notes when available so they can follow instructions better. Have _firstname highlight reading materials as they read to help with their comprehension and note-taking skills (when class notes are available). 

_firstname has been receiving special education services in the resource classroom and has been making progress in this setting. However, based on the evaluation results, the team would like to consider increasing _firstname's service minutes to provide them with further, specially designed academic instruction to address areas of need. The team also believes that adding counseling services to _firstname's IEP will aid in developing _firstname's social skills.

The IEP team should continue the academic goals developed in November 2021 to address _firstname's learning needs. The team should consider continuing goals in _firstname's basic reading skills, reading fluency, reading comprehension, math problem-solving, and written expression.

_firstname benefits from continuing modifications/accommodations to support their academic deficits and impulsive behaviors in the general education classroom. _firstname has demonstrated growth across their academic and social-emotional goals outlined in their Individualized Education Program (IEP).

_firstname may benefit from receiving educational services in a self-contained classroom with modifications/accommodations to support academic deficits and behavior needs. _firstname's special education eligibility remains the same with Autism, Mild Intellectual Disability (secondary), and Speech-Language Impairment (secondary).

_firstname benefits from the continuation of modifications/accommodations to support their academic deficits in the general education classroom. Based on the results of this re-evaluation, additions or modifications to the current IEP will be made. In the general education classroom, preferential seating and sitting next to a helpful student are needed.

### Cognitive

#### Verbal Comprehension

- Pair oral instruction with demonstrations, visual examples, and models. Use concrete references familiar to _firstname when presenting new vocabulary or concepts.
- Word instructions clearly, using specific language and vocabulary that is familiar to _firstname. Avoid long and complex sentences.
- During instruction stick to the point - avoid digressions and excessive language.
- Insure understanding for present information before introducing additional information.
- Assist _firstname to express ideas by providing necessary vocabulary words.
- A lack of information and vocabulary may affect reading comprehension. As a result, orally review information _firstname read about in a passage. When necessary, reinterpret information using familiar vocabulary, terms and experiences.
- Use direct instruction methods to teach new words. Model use of the word, cite concrete references to enhance understanding of the word, have _firstname use the word in various tasks and contexts, and provide immediate feedback/error correction. Attempt to link new vocabulary to prior learning and familiar experiences.
- Attempt to expand _firstname's vocabulary by substituting more sophisticated or precise terms for them. For instance, when _firstname says their dog 'runs around and barks', restate the description by stating, 'Oh, your dog is frisky.'

#### Fluid Reasoning

- Due to difficulty with deductive reasoning, _firstname experiences problems using rules or a set of procedures to solve problems. As a result, use discovery learning to provide experiences to assist them in understanding why a rule or principle works. Work from the bottom up by showing them how observations result in the formation of a rule. After _firstname understands why, they might be able to generalize the use of a rule or procedure to solve new problems.
- Due to difficulty with inferential reasoning, _firstname may experience confusion with discovery learning in which they are expected to arrive at a rule to explain examples. _firstname appears to work best when a rule is stated or a well-defined set of steps is established to solve a problem.
- To promote understanding and generalization in use of a rule or procedure, clearly describe the rule or procedure and provide numerous concrete examples, particularly from _firstname's experience.
- Develop understanding of abstract concepts by describing concrete, familiar elements of the concept (e.g., fruit can be eaten, grows on trees, has a seed or stone and has skin). In addition, employ concrete examples including pictures, demonstrations and manipulatives.
- Break complex tasks or procedures into component parts. After _firstname masters one part, move onto the next.
- Help _firstname sort out relevant from irrelevant information when solving a problem.
- Move slowly when presenting new information and tie new concepts into previously mastered concepts and information.
- Teach new information in groups or families and clarify how the items or examples are alike.
- Provide a routine or practiced sequence for approaching a difficult or complex task. A practiced routine will help _firstname solve problems despite difficulty understanding how and why a procedure works. It may be necessary to define when and under what circumstances a procedure is to be used.

#### Working Memory

- Use a top down approach to instruction in order to lessen memory demands. In this approach, the product is presented as a whole before its component parts are described or taught. For example, when teaching phonetic decoding, say the word first and then help _firstname phonetically analyze the word.
- Break instructions into parts, presenting only one or two parts at a time. Establish understanding or mastery of one component before moving onto the next.
- Teach information in easily recognized groups or families to facilitate memory.
- When teaching, provide a written or pictorial model that _firstname can refer to. Use of graphic organizers can be helpful. Write key terms on the board so they can readily refer to them.
- Repeat important information at a high rate, emphasizing key words by tone of voice.

#### Long-Term Retrieval

- Employ multiple modalities (e.g., writing, speaking, listening, etc.) when _firstname rehearses rote information.
- Help _firstname learn to break a long list of information into small parts or chunks of seven or fewer items. Encourage _firstname to master one small group before moving to the next.
- Discuss the meaning of a story or text immediately after it is read. Ask _firstname to elaborate on what was read. Memory for information will be improved if _firstname has a good understanding of the concept and is able to make more associations.
- Provide opportunities for _firstname to use a concept or skill to solve a problem. _firstname is more likely to retain information which has been put into practice.
- Prompt _firstname to elaborate on and reason with information and concepts taught. For instance, they are more likely to remember that Paraguay is one of the poorest countries in South America if they develops reasons for this condition (e.g., land locked, small country, lack of natural resources, arid climate, etc.).
- Repetition: _firstname rehearses information by orally repeating it or writing it several times. Rehearsal will be most beneficial if it occurs shortly after learning and occurs intermittently thereafter.
- Acronym: _firstname forms a memorable (i.e., silly, outrageous, familiar) phrase or sentence using the first letters of the words or terms to be recalled (e.g., My waffle is under the new car to recall the seven mountain states of Montana, Wyoming, etc.).
- Method of Loci: This strategy involves _firstname imagining themself walking through a familiar location such as a bedroom or walking to school. Then, _firstname imagines placing a term, word or element to be recalled in prominent locations along the route. When it is necessary to recall the information, they mentally retraces the route. The mental image of the prominent locations along the route elicits the corresponding element to be recalled.

#### Visual Processing

- Avoid relying excessively on visual models, diagrams and demonstrations during instruction with _firstname. Accompany visual demonstrations with oral explanations.
- When using visual demonstrations or models to teach a skill or concept, be prepared to move slowly and repeat visual demonstrations as needed.
- Break spatial tasks into component parts and provide a verbal set of instructions to match each part. For instance, provide a sequenced verbal strategy to help a student work through the steps of a math computation problem such as regrouping in subtraction.
- _firstname may experience difficulty forming a visual representation of a concept in their mind (e.g., change of solar position with latitude). As a result, provide hands on, concrete experiences and manipulatives when teaching an abstract concept that is visual in nature. Accompany these concrete experiences with verbal explanations.

#### Auditory Processing

- When practical, word instructions individually to the student in order to avoid competition with extraneous background sounds.
- Seat _firstname in close proximity to the teacher in order to facilitate monitoring and to individualize instructions.
- Face _firstname when speaking.
- Articulate clearly and avoid speaking quickly.
- Word directions and instructions clearly, succinctly and in simple terms.
- Encourage _firstname to ask questions and seek help if they does not understand.

#### Processing Speed

- Reduce the need for handwriting; provide _firstname with outlines of class notes.
- Shorten assignments when possible. For instance, have _firstname complete only even numbered problems on a worksheet.
- Provide extended time for tests and class assignments.
- Break down big projects and assignments into smaller ones with multiple deadlines instead of expecting one large project by one due date.
- Teach _firstname to cover their work so that only one or a few problems are visible; thus helping reduce distractions.
- Grade _firstname's work based on mastery instead of work completion.

#### Visual Spatial

- During basic math computation practice, _firstname would benefit from being provided with a number line so they can refer back to it during math exercises.
- To support early reading skills, work with _firstname on understanding the sequence of letters in words. Give them a sheet of paper with a box for each letter within a word on it. Then provide them a cut out of each letter and ask them to create words. For instance, if the word is CAT give them a sheet of paper with three boxes and the letters C-A-T on separate pieces of paper. Ask them to place the letters in the boxes to spell CAT. This type of intervention reduces the load on their visual spatial sketchpad while still teaching the necessary skills for reading.

#### Orthographic Processing

- To help with alphabetic knowledge, give _firstname a piece of paper or white board divided into four parts. Follow this sequence for each letter: (section one) trace the letter, (section 2) copy the letter, (section 3) write the letter from memory, (section 4) write with eyes closed.
- To help develop orthographical awareness, provide _firstname with extra practice reading/spelling high frequency irregular words (e.g. once, said) from word lists emphasizing (highlighting in some way) the irregular elements. (e.g. the ëaií grapheme in said).
- To help _firstname develop fluency, ensure daily reading of text that is at their level and practice and monitor progress of oral reading with repeated readings of continuous text.

#### Automaticity

- To build automaticity, have _firstname participate in repeated practice of foundational concepts, such as identifying letters and knowing basic math facts.
- Even after _firstname seems to understand a concept and displays mastery, continue practicing basic skills to make them more automatic. This process is called overlearning and the more overlearned a subject is the more automatic it becomes.

#### Cognitive Proficiency

- Provide _firstname with clear, consistent, and predictable expectations for behavior.
- Give advance notice of transitions, upcoming activities, etc.
- Allow more time responding to questions and decision making.
- Provide fewer choices.
- Break up larger tasks into smaller ones.

### Academics

#### Phonological Processing

- To help _firstname improve their ability to use phoneme-grapheme relationships, discourage reliance on pictures as aids for word recognition.
- Praise _firstname for any attempts they makes at pronouncing unknown words when reading aloud. Encourage them to try and identify words rather than guessing or skipping over words.
- Provide explicit instruction in phonic elements. The focus of phonics instruction should be to help _firstname see how letters relate to sounds, and then how letters and sounds are used to read and spell words.
- Use the words in _firstname's sight vocabulary as a basis for building phonic skills. For example, start with a word that they automatically recognizes, such as run, and then show them how that pattern can help them identify a new word, such as fun. Help promote generalization of common patterns by frequently pointing out similarities in words.
- Prior to having _firstname read a passage, underline any multisyllabic words that they may have difficulty pronouncing. Review pronunciation of the words. Have _firstname then practice reading the words fluently in context.

#### Decoding

- Use a multi-sensory approach to help _firstname learn about each letter of the alphabet. For instance, have them write letters in shaving cream, color all the letter A's they sees in a book, or use letter magnets to play different games together. The goal is to increase letter knowledge first then move on to letter sounds and eventually letters within words.
- Teach _firstname how to chunk words. Chunking is breaking down words into smaller parts. Ask them to look at a word and break up each letter and sound out each letter within the word. After _firstname masters breaking down individual letters, increase to 2 letter chunks.

#### Letter Identification

- Teach _firstname to sing the alphabet song. Prior familiarity with the letter names will make it easier for them to learn the association between the names and the letter shapes. When teaching the song, however, make sure that _firstname knows where the breaks are between letter names. For example, they needs to be thinking, 'L, M, N, O, P' rather than 'elemenopee'.
- If _firstname has difficulty learning some of the letter names, make drawings out of those letters to strengthen the association between shape and name. For example, make a bee out of an uppercase B.
- Provide multisensory instruction to aid in letter learning. When teaching _firstname to associate letters with their names, teach only one letter-name at a time. To promote retention and attention, incorporate tactile-kinesthetic activities into instruction. Activities may include having _firstname trace glitter letters while saying the letter name, put letter forms into their proper place in a puzzle jig while reminding themself of its name, or, working with another student, making the shape of the letter with their bodies while saying (shouting, singing) its name.
- Guide _firstname to activate, organize, and develop knowledge of the relationship between letters and words. Games are particularly helpful in this regard. For example, play games requiring students to come up with words starting with specified letters, such as Grandmother's Trip (go through the alphabet but do not require _firstname to recall a previous items named) or games wherein _firstname has to name objects within a given category and starting with a particular letter (e.g., 'My family owns a pet store and they sell something that begins with the letter C'. With _firstname's help, brainstorm as many words as you can generate. Continue the game with another letter).

#### Reading Fluency

- Use guided repeated oral reading to improve word recognition and fluency. Have _firstname read the same passage several times orally. Provide them with systematic and explicit feedback and guidance.
- Have _firstname listen to a recorded (audio-book) passage or a short book several times as they reads along with the audio-book. When they has mastered the passage or book, have them read it to someone else.
- Because _firstname's decoding is slow and effortful, most of _firstname attention is directed to word read accuracy rather than trying to understand what they are reading. Be sure to provide _firstname with necessary support in the classroom. This may include taped books, peer readers, extended time, and modified instructional materials.
- Teach _firstname how to slow down their reading when they encounters difficult material and to reread passages when the meaning is unclear.

#### Reading Comprehension

- When providing instruction in reading comprehension, ensure that _firstname's instructional materials are at the independent reading level in word recognition. Materials at the independent level will allow _firstname to devote their full attention to the comprehension activities.
- Present meaningful reading assignments to motivate _firstname's intent to understand the reading material. For example, within text have _firstname locate and take notes on information that they can discuss with a small group.
- When choosing reading comprehension materials for _firstname, evaluate the books on decoding level and sentence cohesiveness. Be aware that high-interest, low-vocabulary books may obstruct comprehension rather than facilitate it.
- Schedule time daily for reading authentic texts. Read texts to _firstname that will help increase their knowledge base and vocabulary, and encourage them to read a variety of different types of text.
- Provide _firstname with daily readings of text that are at the independent or instructional reading levels. When text at the frustration level is unavoidable (e.g., entire class reading an on-grade level book), provide supported reading (e.g., partner reading, taped books).
- Before _firstname reads a textbook, color-code with a yellow highlighter the sections that are most important to read.

#### Reading Vocabulary

- Make flashcards with words on the front and definitions on the back for words that _firstname does not know. Mix in word cards that they does now to build up confidence for the task.
- Use words in place of known words in the same sentence to help build vocabulary. For instance, you could say 'I am so cold, it is frigid in here'.
- Encourage _firstname to ask questions about words that are unfamiliar to them.

#### Math Concepts and Application

- Immediately after _firstname has demonstrated what appears to be true understanding of a process or concept, ask them if they would be willing to teach it to someone else. Teaching forces one to clarify their own understanding of a process. Make sure the teacher is available to help if they needs help.
- Teach _firstname how to use a number line, counting forward and backward, to solve addition and subtraction problems.
- When reviewing computations with _firstname, place the emphasis on how they solved the problems, rather than on the accuracy of the solutions.
- Help _firstname develop self-monitoring skills by estimating answers to math calculations. Have them estimate the answer and write it by the side of a problem before they calculates the answer.
- Before _firstname works a page of math computation problems, have them color code the operation signs. Help them decide on a color for each of the four signs and consistently highlight or trace each in its own color.

#### Math Computation

- Continuously reinforce previously learned facts interspersed with practice of more recently learned facts. Continue fact practice even when _firstname seems to know them automatically.
- Do not have _firstname compete with other students when practicing math facts. Instead, have _firstname keep their own private performance chart. Draw an analogy to a runner's 'Personal Best.'
- At this time, do not spend time trying to get _firstname to learn facts that they has historically been unable to recall. Instead, for computation problems, give _firstname pocket-sized charts with addition and multiplication facts. Teach _firstname how to use the addition chart for subtraction and the multiplication chart for division. _firstname may use the chart any time _firstname wants for the answers to math facts but encourage _firstname to guess the answer before looking. That way, _firstname gets immediate reinforcement if _firstname is right and immediate correction if _firstname is wrong. Additionally, eventually, visualizing the location of the answer may help in retrieving it. When a fact has become truly automatic, _firstname should black it out. This will continuously strengthen their ability to recall the fact as well as allow _firstname to see how many facts _firstname has left to learn.
- Have practice sessions with flash cards so _firstname can enhance their math fluency. Additionally, using flash cards that have the answer recorded on the reverse side, have _firstname practice facts for several minutes daily. Provide frequent review of the newly mastered facts.

#### Written Expression

- Before writing, have _firstname consider the purpose, their point of view, and the audience who will be reading their paper.
- Adapt all writing assignments to match _firstname's present level of oral language skill. Adjust the grading criteria accordingly.
- Reduce the amount of writing that _firstname is expected to complete, both in the classroom and for homework.
- Provide daily guided discussions that will help _firstname increase their awareness of the strategies that _firstname uses when writing. Use brief teacher-student conferences to help _firstname understand how _firstname approaches writing tasks and then how they can use alternative strategies.

#### Spelling

- Integrate instruction in spelling and word identification so that _firstname sees the connections between phonemes and graphemes as well as between graphemes and phonemes.
- Emphasize the functional use of spelling. Demonstrate the importance of correct spelling in practical and social situations.
- Provide _firstname with a reduced list of spelling words. Begin with five words a week. As performance improves, increase the number of words on the list.
- Dictate to _firstname words with phonically regular spellings, one at a time. Pronounce the sounds of the word separately and slowly in sequence. Remind them to write each letter sound as they hears it.
- Provide corrective feedback to _firstname immediately after completion of a spelling test. Have _firstname touch each letter of the word with their pencil as you spell the word out loud. Have them correct each word that has an error.

#### Listening Comprehension

- Use Differentiated Instruction to teach lessons in a variety of ways.
- Use repetition frequently and ask _firstname to repeat information back in their own words.
- Provide copies of notes so _firstname can refer to their notes during lessons.

#### Oral Expression

- Allow ample opportunities to practice without penalty (e.g., brainstorming, conferencing, sharing).
- Provide questions/topics in advance to allow time for preparation.
- Increase the 'wait time' for expecting a response. For instance, count silently to 10.
- Incorporate oral recitation activities such as poetry readings, parts in plays, etc. to help _firstname build expressive fluency.
- Let _firstname speak regularly through combinations of the following: a) answering questions and participating in discussions, b) taking positions and arguing those positions in class, c) debating others, d) making formal and informal presentations, and e) engaging in or analyzing oral expression processes.

### Behavioral

#### Executive Functioning

- Provide _firstname with an assignment notebook to help organize homework and seatwork.
- Help _firstname create color-coded folders and/or binders to organize assignments for different academic subjects.
- Provide _firstname with an extra set of books or electronic versions of books for use at home. This eliminates the student having to remember to bring books back and forth.
- Teach _firstname to use a calendar for scheduling assignments. Tape a schedule of planned daily activities to their desk to help with time management and transitions.
- Place _firstname in close proximity to instruction so the teacher can monitor their work and intervene when appropriate.

#### Inattention

- Set time limits for completing assignments and classroom tasks, use a visual timer (clock, sand timer, etc.) so _firstname is reminded of the time limits set for the task.
- Ensure that _firstname has a clear desk/work area before beginning a new task or lesson.
- Have a more desirable task before a less desirable one.
- Give _firstname choices about which task/assignment to work on.
- Check in with _firstname frequently.
- Provide written directions or steps, or a visual model of a completed project. Teach _firstname how to refer to these items as reminders of process steps to complete tasks. This strategy is particularly helpful for long-term projects.

#### Hyperactivity

- Allow _firstname to take frequent movement breaks; if the classroom environment allows it, place their desk in the back of the room and allow movement throughout lessons/lectures.
- Encourage acceptable outlets for motor behavior. If _firstname distracts other students by playing with objects, substitute an alternative motor behavior that will not distract others. Give _firstname a soft 'stress ball' and encourage them to squeeze it whenever they has the need for motor movement.
- Selective ignoring can be an effective teacher response to minor fidgeting or other motor behaviors. If _firstname's 'fidgety' behaviors are relatively minor and do not seriously derail classroom instruction, the teacher should simply not pay attention to them.
- Seat _firstname next to peers who can generally ignore disruptive behaviors.
- Place _firstname in close proximity to instruction so the teacher can monitor their work.

#### Testing Anxiety

- Use deep breathing before going into a testing environment.
- Avoid sugary drinks such as soda pop before testing. Sugary drinks can cause blood sugar to peak and then drop, or caffeinated beverages such as energy drinks or coffee, which can increase anxiety.
- Create a study plan and consistently study what the test will assess, feeling prepared will help lessen anxiety.

#### Motivation

- Identify questions that _firstname can answer and call on them to participate or share.
- Focus on relationship development, building a strong relationship with _firstname will motivate them to meet your expectations.
- Show an interest and find out about the opinions and ideas that _firstname has.
- Avoid lecturing _firstname about their lack of motivation.

#### Planning

- Teach _firstname to create outlines and plans for writing assignments and bigger projects that can guide them through the process.
- Ask _firstname to show and explain how they planned for a presented task and provide appropriate feedback if necessary.
- Give _firstname extra time before starting a task to 'stop and think' and encourage prior planning.

#### Sleep Problems

- Avoid screen time and bright light exposure 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime.
- Avoid eating a large meal before bedtime, if _firstname is hungry give them a light, healthy snack.
- Remove electronic devices from _firstname's bedroom before bedtime.
- To help regulate _firstname's circadian rhythm, establish a sleep routine with a consistent sleep and wake time.

#### Impulse Control Issues

- To help strengthen _firstname's self-regulation skills and avoid feelings of embarrassment, develop a private signal with them to be used when a frequent behavior occurs (for instance, if they often gets out of their seat, look at them and tap your nose to remind them to return to their seat).
- Use positive reinforcement based on the length of time _firstname can be successful at controlling their impulsive behavior. As they demonstrates higher levels of success, gradually increase the length of time required for reinforcement.
- Provide _firstname with decision-making criteria. For example, a) take into consideration how other persons may be affected; b) consider possible consequences; c) take into consideration different courses of action; d) thoroughly assess the specific situation; e) decide what is the best course of action for the individual student. Model these steps yourself in the classroom.
- Provide visual reminders of how to avoid impulsive behavior. For example, post an index card on _firstname's desk that says STOP THINK ACT.
- Develop a contract with _firstname in which you specify what type of behavior is expected and what they can expect in the way of reinforcement if the contract is honored.

#### Social Skills

- Use social stories to help _firstname understand appropriate behavior and responses to typical social interactions.
- Teach _firstname to stand about an arm's length away from people when they are talking. When they are standing in line, talk about how close to be to the person in front of them and talk about keeping their hands to themself. You might role-play various scenarios to help _firstname practice describing appropriate personal space.
- Praise _firstname for sharing and indicate how it makes others feel. Say something like, 'You chose to share your snack with your sister. I bet they feels happy about that. That's a nice thing to do.'
