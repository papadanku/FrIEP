## Cross-Battery Assessment · XBASS v2.4

A cross battery assessment approach was used to assess the examinee's current cognitive abilities. A cross-battery approach uses information from multiple test batteries (i.e., various tests) to follow-up on weak or inconsistent performances on particular tasks and, thereby, help guide educational decisions.

### Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children · Fifth Edition (WISC-V)

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Fifth Edition (WISC-V) was administered for the cognitive assessment. The WISC-V is a standardized measure of cognitive development for children between the ages of six and sixteen that strongly emphasizes child-friendly, developmentally appropriate features and tasks. The WISC-V is an individually administered assessment that reports scores as Standard Scores (SS) with a mean (average) of 100 and standard deviation of 15, with most people scoring between 85 and 115. Cognitive, or mental, processes are foundational skills used in thinking, remembering, and learning. These processes and other abilities and traits combine to form an individual's general intellectual ability. Tests administered in the school environment do not capture every aspect of intelligence; however, these tests help predict how intense instruction needs to be for the individual to master academic content.

### Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children · II Normative Update

The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition Normative Update (KABC-II NU) was designed as a clinical instrument and can be used to assess the cognitive abilities of children and adolescents for psychoeducational evaluations. The KABC-II NU is widely promoted as a fair assessment of children and adolescents from African American, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American backgrounds.

The KABC-II NU is a test of intellectual ability designed for use with children ages 3:0-18:11. The KABC-II NU was individually administered as a measure of general intellectual functioning or aptitude. The primary subtest scores contribute to the primary indexes, which indicate intellectual functioning in four (ages 3-6) or five (ages 7-18) cognitive areas that represent broad areas of cognitive abilities. Performance on the KABC-II NU is reported through a number of different scores. These include standard scores, which have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The classification of these scores range from lower extreme to upper extreme. Index scores between 85 and 115 are considered in the average range. Subtest scores between 7 and 12 are considered in the average range.

### Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities

The current assessment utilizes the Woodcock-Johnson IV as the base instrument to assess cognitive skills. The WJ IV follows the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model of cognitive processing and is based on seven primary (broad factor) and a number of secondary (narrow ability) areas. Standard scores for each of the areas in the 85 to 115 range are considered to be within the average range.

### Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing · Second Edition (CTOPP-2)

Phonological processing is the ability to see or hear a word, break it down to discrete sounds, and then associate each sound with letter(s) that make up the word. The examinee's phonological processing skills were assessed with the Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, Second Edition (CTOPP-2). The CTOPP-2 assesses three areas directly related to phonological processing: phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid naming. All three components of phonological processing are important for speech production as well as the development of spoken and written language skills. Additionally, deficits in phonological processes also contribute to difficulties in reading.

### Broad Areas

#### Comprehension Knowledge (Gc)

The ability to communicate (especially verbally), and the ability to reason using previously learned procedures - also refers to the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge of a culture and the effective application of the knowledge. Gc is developed through formal education and general learning experiences.

#### Fluid Reasoning (Gf)

The ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems when faced with a novel task that cannot be performed automatically, and involves manipulating rules, abstracting, generalizing, and identifying logical relationships. Gf is also used in reorganization, transformation, and the extrapolation of information. Gf processes are minimally dependent on learning and acculturation.

#### Short-Term Working Memory (Gwm)

The ability to hold information in immediate awareness and then use the information within a few seconds. Gwm includes working memory capacity.

#### Long-Term Storage (Glr)

The ability to store information in long-term memory, and to fluently retrieve the information through association.

#### Visual Processing (Gv)

The ability to generate, perceive, analyze, synthesize, manipulate, transform and think with visual (mental) images, patterns and stimuli.

#### Auditory Processing (Ga)

The ability to perceive, discriminate, analyze and synthesize patterns among auditory stimuli. Ga also relates to phonological awareness.

#### Processing Speed (Gs)

The speed and efficiency to fluently perform simple cognitive tasks automatically, especially when under pressure to maintain focused attention and concentration; attentive speediness.

# Interpretation of Cognitive Assessment Results Templates

## Template: Cross-Battery Assessment · XBASS v2.4

Cognitive, or mental, processes are foundational skills used in the act of thinking, remembering, and learning. These processes, along with other abilities and traits, combine to form an individual's general intellectual ability. Tests administered in the school environment do not capture every aspect of intelligence; however, these tests are useful in predicting how intense instruction needs to be in order for the individual to master academic content. A cross battery assessment approach was used to assess the examinee's current cognitive abilities. A cross-battery approach uses information from multiple test batteries (i.e., various tests) to follow-up on weak or inconsistent performances on particular tasks and, thereby, help guide educational decisions.

Crystallized Intelligence (Gc): Crystallized Intelligence, or verbal comprehension, refers to an individual's knowledge base (or general fund of information) that has built up over time, beginning in infancy. It is like your own personal library or everything you know. Crystallized Intelligence involves knowledge of one's culture (e.g., who is the President of the United States?) as well as verbal- or language-based knowledge that has been developed during general life experiences, and formal schooling (e.g., understanding words and their meaning; understanding street signs, acquiring developmentally appropriate knowledge of current events and history). Having well developed Crystallized Intelligence means that one understands and uses language well, has an average or better vocabulary, has good listening skills, and is able to use language well via verbal expression. The examinee's performance on the measures of Crystallized Intelligence fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Fluid Reasoning (Gf): Fluid Reasoning refers to the type of thinking that an individual may use when faced with a relatively new task that cannot be performed automatically (e.g., by relying on previously learned habits or scripts). It includes such tasks as forming and recognizing concepts (e.g., how are a dog, cat, and cow alike?), identifying and perceiving relationships (e.g., sun is to morning as moon is to night), drawing inferences (e.g., after reading a story, answering the question- What will John do next?), and/or reorganizing or transforming information (e.g., selecting one of several pictures to complete a puzzle/pattern). Overall, this ability can be thought of as a problem-solving type of intelligence. Fluid reasoning/problem solving skills are important for reading comprehension (e.g., making inferences from text), math (e.g., figuring out how to set up a math problem by using information provided in a word problem), and writing (e.g., writing a persuasive essay). The examinee's performance on the measures of Fluid Reasoning fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Short-Term Memory (Gsm): Short-Term Memory, or working memory, is the ability to hold information in one's mind and then use it within a few seconds. The most common example of short-term memory is holding a phone number in one's mind long enough to dial it. Working memory is also a part of the short-term memory system and involves manipulating or transforming information and using it in some way (e.g., saying the months of the year backwards or doing mental math). Short-Term Memory skills are important for reading, writing, and math. The examinee's performance on the Short-Term Memory measures fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Long Term Retrieval (Glr): Long Term Retrieval is defined as an individual's ability to take in and store information efficiently and retrieve it later through association. Long-Term Retrieval should not be confused with long-term memory, which represents the stores of acquired knowledge. In contrast, long-term retrieval is the processing efficiency through which information is initially stored and then later recalled. Weaknesses in this area negatively impact all aspects of academics particularly reading fluency and math facts. Additionally, individuals with weaknesses in this area often perform poorly on tests. The examinee's performance on the measures of Long Term Retrieval fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Visual Processing (Gv): Visual Processing, or visual spatial processing, refers to an individual's ability to think about visual patterns (e.g., what is the shortest route from your house to school?) and visual images (e.g., what would this shape look like if I turned it upside down?). This type of ability also involves generating, perceiving, and analyzing visual patterns and visual information (e.g., which three shapes go together to make this shape?). Additional examples of this type of ability include putting puzzles together, completing a maze (such as the ones often seen on children's menus in restaurants), and interpreting a graph or chart. The examinee's performance on the measures of Visual Processing fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Auditory Processing (Ga): Auditory Processing refers to the ability to perceive, analyze, and synthesize a variety of auditory information (e.g., sounds). Examples of auditory processing include listening to words with missing letters and saying the correct word (e.g., hearing 'olipop' and saying 'lollipop') and recognizing sound patterns. Phonetic coding or phonological awareness/processing is very important during the elementary school years. Students who have difficulty with processing auditory information may have problems learning letter-to-sound correspondences (e.g., listening to the sound 'ba' and identifying it as the letter 'b' when given a list of letters to choose from), reading nonsense words (e.g., bab), and sounding out words because of difficulty segmenting, analyzing, and synthesizing speech sounds. The examinee's performance on the Auditory Processing tasks fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

Processing Speed (Gs): Processing Speed involves the ability to fluently perform simple clerical-type tasks, especially when under pressure to maintain focused attention and concentration. It can also be thought of as how quickly one can think or how quickly one can take simple tests that require simple decisions (e.g., math calculation fluency). Faster processing of information can help conserve working memory resources. On the other hand, impairment in this area reduces a student's efficiency in performing all types of mental operations causing them to respond more slowly to classroom tasks. The examinee's performance on the measures of Processing Speed fell within the ?? range (SS = ??; PR = ??).

The Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition Normative Update (KABC-II NU) was designed as a clinical instrument and can be used to assess the cognitive abilities of children and adolescents for psychoeducational evaluations. The KABC-II NU is widely promoted as a fair assessment of children and adolescents from African American, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian American backgrounds.

The KABC-II NU is a test of intellectual ability designed for use with children ages 3:0-18:11. The KABC-II NU was individually administered as a measure of general intellectual functioning or aptitude. The primary subtest scores contribute to the primary indexes, which indicate intellectual functioning in four (ages 3-6) or five (ages 7-18) cognitive areas that represent broad areas of cognitive abilities. Performance on the KABC-II NU is reported through a number of different scores. These include standard scores, which have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The classification of these scores range from lower extreme to upper extreme. Index scores between 85 and 115 are considered in the average range. Subtest scores between 7 and 12 are considered in the average range.

The KABC-II NU produces a global score, the Fluid-Crystallized Index (FCI) or the Nonverbal Index (NVI). The FCI is designed to measure general cognitive ability that emphasizes the complexity of children's problem solving and deemphasizes school skills such as reading, mathematics, and writing. The NVI can be used to facilitate the valid assessment of children who have difficulty understanding verbal stimuli, responding orally, or both, and for whom neither the FCI or MPI would be appropriate. Groups of children in which using the NVI may be most appropriate are CLD/EL students, children with hearing impairments, moderate to severe language disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and related disorders that make communication difficult.

This assessment was chosen for _firstname's evaluation because the norm sample includes adequate representation of persons similar in demographics to _firstname. _His/Her performance is described below for each cognitive ability area assessed.

Fluid-Crystallized Index (FCI): The Fluid-Crystallized Index (FCI) is designed to measure general cognitive ability that emphasizes the complexity of children's problem solving and deemphasizes school skills such as reading, mathematics, and writing. The primary subtest scores contribute to the primary indexes, which indicate intellectual functioning in four (ages 3-6) or five (ages 7-18) cognitive areas that represent broad areas of cognitive abilities. _firstname's FCI score is in the ?? range when compared to other children _his/her age (FCI = ??). Although the KABC-II NU measures various aspects of ability, a child's scores on this assessment can also be influenced by many factors that are not captured in this report. While the FCI provides a broad representation of cognitive ability, describing _firstname's domain-specific performance allows for a more thorough understanding of _his/her functioning in distinct areas. Some children perform at approximately the same level in all of these areas, but many others display areas of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

Nonverbal Index (NVI): The Nonverbal Index (NVI) can be used to facilitate the valid assessment of children who have difficulty understanding verbal stimuli, responding orally, or both, and for whom neither the FCI or MPI would be appropriate. The NVI is designed to measure general cognitive ability for children with communication difficulties. _firstname's NVI score is in the ?? range when compared to other children _his/her age (NVI = ??). Although the KABC-II NU measures various aspects of ability, a child's scores on this assessment can also be influenced by many factors that are not captured in this report. While the NVI provides a broad representation of cognitive ability, describing _firstname's domain-specific performance allows for a more thorough understanding of _his/her functioning in distinct areas. Some children perform at approximately the same level in all of these areas, but many others display areas of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

Short-Term Memory (Gsm): The Sequential/Gsm (short-term memory) is the broad ability needed to respond appropriately, an ability that requires apprehending and holding information in immediate awareness briefly and then using that information within a few seconds, before it is forgotten. During these subtests, the child is presented with a set of stimuli and must reproduce the stimuli in the exact order they were presented. _firstname's short-term memory was in the ?? range. This indicates that _firstname performs at a level commensurate/lower/higher than _his/her same aged peers. This is an area of relative/normative weakness/strength for _firstname.

Visual Processing (Gv): The Simultaneous/Gv (visual processing) is the broad ability that allows one to perceive, manipulate, and think with visual patterns and stimuli, and to mentally rotate objects in space. During these subtests, the child is presented with a problem that includes visual stimuli and requires some type of spatial manipulation and nonverbal reasoning to solve correctly. _firstname's visual processing was in the ?? range. This indicates that _firstname performs at a level commensurate/lower/higher than _his/her same aged peers. This is an area of relative/normative weakness/strength for _firstname.

Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr): The Learning/Glr (long-term storage and retrieval) is the broad ability to both store information in the long-term memory and to retrieve that information fluently and efficiently. During these subtests, the child is taught verbal labels that are paired with visual stimuli and, first, needs to learn these paired associations and then needs to recall them after a delay of about 20-25 minutes. _firstname's long-term storage and retrieval was in the ?? range. This indicates that _firstname performs at a level commensurate/lower/higher than _his/her same aged peers. This is an area of relative/normative weakness/strength for _firstname.

Fluid Reasoning (Gf): The Planning/Gf (fluid reasoning) is the broad ability that refers to a variety of mental operations that a person can use to solve a novel problem with adaptability and flexibility-operations such as drawing inferences, understanding implications, and applying inductive or deductive reasoning. During these subtests, the child is presented with a novel nonverbal problem, different from the kinds of problems taught in school, and must use verbally mediated reasoning to figure out the correct answer. _firstname's fluid reasoning was in the ?? range. This indicates that _firstname performs at a level commensurate/lower/higher than _his/her same aged peers. This is an area of relative/normative weakness/strength for _firstname.

Crystalized Knowledge (Gc): The Knowledge/Gc (crystallized ability) is the broad ability that reflects the amount of specific knowledge that a person has acquired within a culture, as well as the person's ability to apply this knowledge effectively. During these subtests, the child is asked a variety of questions that assess knowledge of words and facts, using a variety of verbal and pictorial stimuli and requiring either verbal (naming) or nonverbal (pointing) responses. Some items also require reasoning ability. _firstname's crystallized ability was in the ?? range. This indicates that _firstname performs at a level commensurate/lower/higher than _his/her same aged peers. This is an area of relative/normative weakness/strength for _firstname.
